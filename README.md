# Go Webtoons WebApi
this is a simple program based on [this great project](https://github.com/robinovitch61/webtoon-dl)
well, its just a wrapper for Robinovitch's code that allows me to use it remotely with [my KoReader plugin](https://github.com/trybula/KoReaderWebtoonsDl)

### Configuration
Before running you need to insert ONE api key's SHA256 hash to the valid_key_hash.txt file
