# Go Webtoons WebApi
this is a simple program based on [this great project](https://github.com/robinovitch61/webtoon-dl)
well, its just a wrapper for Robinovitch's code that allows me to use it remotely with [my KoReader plugin](https://github.com/trybula/KoReaderWebtoonsDl)

### Configuration
Reccomended way of running this at your server is using docker. Docker file is uploaded to the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/trybekszybek/go_webtoons_web_api), and every major change and fix will be updated. This is very convinient considering that this is only beta version, still under heavy developement
